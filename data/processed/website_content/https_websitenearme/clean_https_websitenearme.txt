Who we are
Our website address is: https://websitenearme.online.  This is the demo site for

.
Comments
When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
Questions & Chatbot
When you type questions into our chatbots, we use this data to train our chatbots.  They are also secured with levels of threat protection to include abuse of our chatbot access, spam, or other threats.   This data is passed through openAI, therefore it is highly recommended to refrain from posting any private data.  We are not able to retrieve data sent to the openAI servers.
Media
If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.
Cookies
If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.
If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.
When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select "Remember Me", your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.
If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.
Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
Who we share your data with
If you request a password reset, your IP address will be included in the reset email.
How long we retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
What rights you have over your data
If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.  We can not guarantee we will be able to do this immediately, however, as it is not a typical request for the purposes of this website or any partner sites.
Where your data is sent
Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

Unlock the Power of Data: Improve Your Business and Delight Your Customers
Dear Future Subscriber,
In the ever-evolving business landscape, one factor consistently plays a transformative role: data. You might think that data is a concern for tech giants and large corporations, but it holds equal, if not greater, significance for small businesses like yours.
Why Data Matters
Data is more than just numbers and facts. It's the key to understanding your customers, their preferences, and their needs. By analyzing customer data, you can tailor your products and services to meet these needs, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Personalization is the New Standard
Customers today expect personalized experiences. They want to feel understood and valued. By leveraging data, you can deliver targeted communications, special offers, and services that match their unique interests and needs.
Chatbots: Your 24/7 Customer Service Rep
Imagine a tool that can interact with your customers, answer their queries, and collect vital data around the clock. That's what a chatbot can do. Implementing a chatbot on your website not only improves customer service, but also collects valuable data that can help you understand customer behavior and preferences.
The Power of Predictive Analysis
By analyzing historical data, you can predict future trends and make proactive decisions. This could involve identifying potential high-demand products, forecasting sales, or anticipating customer needs.
Data Security: An Essential Trust Builder
Collecting customer data comes with the responsibility of ensuring its safety. Strong data security measures not only protect your business from cyber threats, but also build trust with your customers.
Take the Next Step
If you don't have a website yet, it's time to establish your online presence. Your website serves as a central hub where you can interact with customers, offer your services, and most importantly, collect and analyze customer data.
If you already have a website, consider implementing tools like chatbots and analytics software. These can help you collect data, gain insights, and deliver a personalized customer experience.
The world of data might seem complex, but the rewards it offers are immense. Start your data journey today and unlock a world of opportunities for your small business.
Best,

what to expect
Fast websites, fast!
This is a simple process that we have automated and streamlined so we can bring you, our beloved local businesses, the same advantage that the nerds in Silicone Valley have been using to get ahead for years.
With the power of Artificial Intelligence and our knowledge of Data Science, Computer Science, Software Development, Business, SEO, and more, we can offer you the same benefits we are enjoying at a fair price.
You simply have to provide us with the pictures, text and logo that you want us to use, and we do the rest.
Once you send us the text and images either by phone, email or online, and pay half the cost of building your website via our purchase orders,  we will guide you through the domain name selection via GoDaddy.
Depending on the domain you want, this can cost between $12/year to thousands/year.  You will pay GoDaddy directly and we will then use our Pro Account to share savings of using their services via our cPanel.
(If you wish to use your own cPanel, we do not provide support for this and encourage you to reach out to GoDaddy.
)
Building your website will take us no more than 3 days, and if you select a trained chatbot, after the 3 days, the website will be live and your trained chatbot will be available within 48 hours  after you provide us the training data.
The training data is simply your answers to specific AI-generated questions about your website.
refunds and returns
We do not provide refunds, but we do allow you to exit your contract if you are not satisfied with your product after the initial setup.  Therefore, if you were building a basic website that cost $500, you would pay us $250 and if you chose to not keep the website, you would not be responsible for the other $250 and we would release your GoDaddy domain and remove any code we had generated.  You would be responsible for your account with GoDaddy, and we will make sure you receive your keys in case you would want to find another web developer.  We would keep the $250 for our time, labor and resources.  However, we think you will love your website!  Because we have been doing this for over 20 years, we have refined the art of scoping your website so that you are perfectly clear about what you will be ultimately paying for and we will both have copies of the exact images and text you asked us to post on your site, so we will always have transparency and data to fall back on in case questions arise.
What if you need more help/ guidance?
We are happy to help you further, in which case we ask you to book an appointment here.  We will send you a list of questions prior to your appointment so that we can both be prepared and make best use of the scheduled time, as these cost $60/hour.

Weekly blog updates help SEO.
Because we are using AI, this means very affordable for you.
You can sign up for our subscripton service and we will autogenerate content for you so your site continues to rank.
If the google algorithms begin detecting AI content and penalizing websites, we will immediately let you know because it will also affect our websites.  At that point, we would need to update our contract terms, if it will require a human to oversee the content.  It is not likely AI will be used to autodetect AI produced content soon, because AI is becoming better at human-like content generation daily.
Our images also fill in your image alt tags and descriptions, which also help with SEO.

SEO Empowers Small Businesses Using AI
In the age of artificial intelligence (AI), small businesses are constantly seeking innovative ways to stay ahead of the competition and unlock success. One powerful tool that has been revolutionizing the digital landscape is search engine optimization (SEO). By cracking the code and harnessing the potential of SEO, small businesses can catapult themselves to new heights in the AI era. In this article, we will explore how SEO can skyrockets small businesses and serve as the secret sauce for their success.
"Cracking the Code: How SEO Skyrockets Small Businesses in the AI Era!"
In the vast digital realm, small businesses often struggle to gain visibility amidst the giants. However, with the advent of AI, search engines have become more intelligent, making SEO an essential ingredient for success. SEO helps small businesses crack the code by optimizing their websites to rank higher in search engine results. By understanding and implementing the latest SEO techniques, businesses can attract a larger audience, increase brand visibility, and drive more organic traffic to their websites. This enables them to compete on a level playing field with larger corporations, giving them an edge in the AI era.
Additionally, AI-powered algorithms now play a significant role in determining search engine rankings. Search engines are becoming increasingly sophisticated in understanding user intent and delivering highly relevant results. SEO empowers small businesses to align their websites with the goals and needs of their target audience, making it easier for search engines to recognize their value. With proper optimization, small businesses can enhance their website's visibility, appear in the top search results, and ultimately reach their desired customers, regardless of the competition.
"The SEO Secret Sauce: Fueling Small Business Success in the AI Age!"
In the AI age, where consumers are bombarded with information, standing out from the crowd is crucial for small businesses. SEO acts as the secret sauce that fuels their success by enabling them to be more discoverable online. By optimizing their website's content, keywords, and meta tags, small businesses can improve their search engine rankings and attract the right audience. This targeted approach helps in creating meaningful connections with potential customers and increases the chances of conversion.
Moreover, SEO offers an opportunity for small businesses to build their brand authority and reputation. By consistently delivering valuable content and optimizing it for search engines, businesses can establish themselves as industry leaders. When customers see a small business consistently appearing in search results and providing valuable information, they are more likely to trust and choose that business over its competitors. This not only enhances brand credibility but also fosters long-term customer loyalty and advocacy.
As the AI era continues to evolve, small businesses must adapt and leverage the power of SEO to unlock their full potential. By cracking the code and understanding the importance of SEO in the digital landscape, small businesses can skyrocket their success and compete with larger corporations. The secret sauce of SEO empowers them to be more visible, reach their target audience, and build a strong online presence. So, embrace the power of SEO in the AI era and watch your small business thrive like never before!
There is no one answer to the question of how AI and SEO interact. Rather, it depends on the specific context and situation. In some cases, AI can help improve SEO by providing better insights into organic search traffic and how to improve the ranking of a website on search engines. Conversely, AI can also help improve SEO by automating the process of finding and analyzing data about a website's performance on search engines.

chatbot openAI subscription
The 1 time $30 fee is the initial setup fee.
You will then need to pay a monthly recurring fee starting in month 2, to openAI (we help set this up for you).  You can begin using your chatbot in month 1.
This is a necessary monthly recurring subscription to have access to your chatGPT openAI key so your chatbot is able to answer client questions online.
Your chatbot will only work if it is using the LLMs available through openAI, so this is necessary in order to build your chatbot(s).
If you have multiple chatbots for 1 website, you only need 1 monthly subscription.
If you have heavy use of your chatbot, you likely will need to increase the amount allotted per month. Heavy use is something like 5k questions in 1 month, however the specifics are outlined in the openAI website.
If you notice your chatbot erring out, please reach out immediately so we can help you adjust your allotted monthly amount through openAI.
Train Your Chatbot- 1 round
We use AI to generate likely questions customers will have about your product.  You then answer these questions for us, and we use it to train the chatbot so that the chatbot knows how to answer them when it is asked on your website. 
Our recommendation is that you train your chatbot for 1 round, then include this information in your website, as it is a set of questions that the AI extracts from your content that is not clear based on your website.  This will reduce the need for much more training initially.  This will also possibly cut back on costs associated with repeatedly running the same questions through your openAI account.
This is not a mandatory product when you purchase a chatbot, but we do highly recommend using this strategy because data is the new gold.
We can set your customer's questions, submitted via your chatbot, to be recorded, so you can begin compiling data that is relevant to your particular store and customer base. 
Having this data is valuable for understanding your customer needs as well as updating info that may be lacking as time progresses.  You always have access to view your own data.  For a small fee, we can send you instructions on how to retrieve your data safely.

WHAT TO EXPECT
Fast websites, fast!
This is a simple process that we have automated and streamlined so we can bring you, our beloved local businesses, the same advantage that the nerds in Silicone Valley have been using to get ahead for years.
With the power of Artificial Intelligence and our knowledge of Data Science, Computer Science, Software Development, Business, SEO, and more, we can offer you the same benefits we are enjoying at a fair price.
You simply have to provide us with the pictures, text and logo that you want us to use, and we do the rest.
Once you send us the text and images either by phone, email or online, and pay half the cost of building your website via our purchase orders,  we will guide you through the domain name selection via GoDaddy.
Depending on the domain you want, this can cost between $12/year to thousands/year.  You will pay GoDaddy directly and we will then use our Pro Account to share savings of using their services via our cPanel.
(If you wish to use your own cPanel, we do not provide support for this and encourage you to reach out to GoDaddy.
)
Building your website will take us no more than 3 days, and if you select a trained chatbot, after the 3 days, the website will be live and your trained chatbot will be available within 48 hours  after you provide us the training data.
The training data is simply your answers to specific AI-generated questions about your website.
REFUNDS AND RETURNS
We do not provide refunds, but we do allow you to exit your contract if you are not satisfied with your product after the initial setup.  Therefore, if you were building a basic website that cost $500, you would pay us $250 and if you chose to not keep the website, you would not be responsible for the other $250 and we would release your GoDaddy domain and remove any code we had generated.  You would be responsible for your account with GoDaddy, and we will make sure you receive your keys in case you would want to find another web developer.  We would keep the $250 for our time, labor and resources.  However, we think you will love your website!  Because we have been doing this for over 20 years, we have refined the art of scoping your website so that you are perfectly clear about what you will be ultimately paying for and we will both have copies of the exact images and text you asked us to post on your site, so we will always have transparency and data to fall back on in case questions arise.
What if you need more help/ guidance?
We are happy to help you further, in which case we ask you to book an appointment here.  We will send you a list of questions prior to your appointment so that we can both be prepared and make best use of the scheduled time, as these cost $60/hour.
We will get back to you ASAP
